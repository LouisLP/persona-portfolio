            As a developer, my journey has been marked by continuous learning and adaptation. What
            started as curiosity about how things work has evolved into a passion for building
            user-centric applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background in creative fields gives me a unique perspective on development â€“ I don't
            just write code, I craft experiences. Every line of code serves a purpose in creating
            something meaningful for users.
          </p>

            Currently working as a Software Engineer at Agile Robots, I'm focused on building
            intuitive interfaces for complex robotics systems using Vue.js, TypeScript, and modern
            web technologies.
